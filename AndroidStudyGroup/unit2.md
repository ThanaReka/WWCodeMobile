Improving the user interface of your app by learning about the different android layouts, Material Design guidelines, and best practices for UI development.We have 3 ‘pathways’ for this unit, each with interactive coding portions.

- Improve your kotlin skills by learning more about Kotlin classes, inheritance, lists and arrays.
- Learn about different UI components that allow you to take user input to build up the layout of your app. Some of these components include: editable text fields, radio buttons, and switches
- Learn how to efficiently display a list of data in a RecyclerView, understand its architecture and how to test the implementation.

### 💡 Tips for learners:
