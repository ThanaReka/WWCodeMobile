## 📝 NOTES:

We have 5 ‘pathways’ for this unit, each with interactive coding portions as follows:

- Learn about Kotlin higher order functions. In addition, you will learn and understand an activity’s lifecycle and how to navigate into and out of activities.
- Learn what Fragments are, their lifecycle and how it differs from the activity lifecycle. You will be introduced to Jetpack Navigation, learn how to pass data between fragments using Safe Args Plugin and learn how to test navigation components.
- Learn how to use Android Jetpack Architecture components to design robust, testable, and maintainable apps. Learn how to retain app data during configuration changes by using ViewModels and LiveData.
- Learn how to implement recommended app architecture practices, how to use a shared ViewModel across fragments in an activity and how to implement up button behavior.
- Implement adaptive layouts using SlidingPaneLayout and add custom back navigation.

### 💡 Tips for learners:

<aside>
👉🏽 After finishing the unit, create your own app and let it support different screen sizes including foldables. In the latest Android studio, we have a resizable emulator, you can use that to test your designs. Don’t forget to write tests for your app. 😎
