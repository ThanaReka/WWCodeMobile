After having gone through 13 chapters on Combine and SwiftUI these past 11 sessions, let’s get some hands on practise! 👩🏻‍💻

We will work on 🌦️ [this Weather app](https://github.com/kroshkaEvan/Weather) and convert it into Combine. Also, this would be a great way to review SwiftUI with MVVM.🤩

You can share your project solutions inside this folder :) 

## 🤔While working on this project, do reflect on aspects such as:

- best practises - Did you notice any code smells like nesting of subscriptions or readability challenges.✅
- your debugging experience 🔬
- How much of the project did you convert to Combine - do you feel the entire project could be reactive, would it be an overuse or does it help? 💭
- what were some learnings you had - example - forgetting to switch to the main thread on subscribe📝
- or anything else - feel free to share some other concerns we ought to consider 🙋🏽‍♀️

**🗣️We can then discuss these in our next session! 👩🏻‍🏫**

Register for our discussion Zoom session on June 2nd on the [WWCode Mobile events page](https://www.womenwhocode.com/mobile/events)

Good luck!
