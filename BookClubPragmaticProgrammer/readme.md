Note: This book is written as a collection of short sections. Each section is self-contained, and addresses a particular topic. Feel free to read the sections in any order—this isn’t a book that needs to be read front-to- back.

The book club series and notes are by our WWCode Mobile volunteers: Devanshi ([@devanshimodha](https://github.com/devanshimodha)), Ren Wah ([@renweview](https://github.com/renweview)) and Fai ([@failynsedik](https://github.com/failynsedik))
